# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: After learning and building up skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning and machine learning . We are tasked to  apply machine learning to sove a real=world challenge: credit card risk using credit card dataset from  Lending Club, a peer to peer lending services company.


After learning and building up skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning and machine learning . We are tasked to  apply machine learning to sove a real=world challenge: credit card risk using credit card dataset from  Lending Club, a peer to peer lending services company.

## The following will be used to empoy different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes to predict credit risk:
  1. Use **imbalanced-learn** and **scikit-learn libraries** to build and evaluate models using resampling
  2. Oversample the data using the **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE algorithms**
  3. Undersample the data using the **ClusterCentroids** algorithm
  4. Use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm
  5. Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**, to predict credit risk.

# Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
